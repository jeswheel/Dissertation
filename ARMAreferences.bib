We performed Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model prediction on the Johns Hopkins epidemiological data to predict the epidemiological trend of the prevalence and incidence of COVID-2019.

abstract = {We develop practical and exact methods of analyzing ARMA (p, q) regression error models in a Bayesian framework by using the Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, and we prove that the kernel of the proposed Markov chain sampler converges to the true density. The procedures can be applied to pure ARMA time series models and to determine features of the likelihood function by choosing appropriate diffuse priors. Our results are unconditional on the initial observations. We also show how the algorithm can be further simplified for the important special cases of stationary AR(p) and invertible MA(q) models. Recursive transformations developed in this paper to diagonalized the covariance matrix of the errors should prove useful in frequentist estimation. Examples with simulated and actual economic data are presented.}

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.}",

  abstract = {We investigated the presence and changes in, long memory features in the returns and volatility dynamics of S\&P 500 and London Stock Exchange using ARMA model. Recently, multifractal analysis has been evolved as an important way to explain the complexity of financial markets which can hardly be described by linear methods of efficient market theory. In financial markets, the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis implies that price returns are serially uncorrelated sequences. In other words, prices should follow a random walk behavior. The random walk hypothesis is evaluated against alternatives accommodating either unifractality or multifractality. Several studies find that the return volatility of stocks tends to exhibit long-range dependence, heavy tails, and clustering. Because stochastic processes with self-similarity possess long-range dependence and heavy tails, it has been suggested that self-similar processes be employed to capture these characteristics in return volatility modeling. The present study applies monthly and yearly forecasting of Time Series Stock Returns in S\&P 500 and London Stock Exchange using ARMA model. The statistical analysis of S\&P 500 shows that the ARMA model for S\&P 500 outperforms the London stock exchange and it is capable for predicting medium or long horizons using real known values. The statistical analysis in London Stock Exchange shows that the ARMA model for monthly stock returns outperforms the yearly. \hspace{0pt}A comparison between S\&P 500 and London Stock Exchange shows that both markets are efficient and have Financial Stability during periods of boom and bust.},
